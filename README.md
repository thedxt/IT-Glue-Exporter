# IT-Glue-Exporter
## IT Glue PWD Exporter
This will export all passwords from IT Glue to a CSV file and it will format it the same way the official IT Glue account export does

This is a modified version of https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/ITGlueBackup

To make this work you need the following
* IT Glue PowerShell Wrapper installed (https://github.com/itglue/powershellwrapper)
* An API key in your IT Glue that has Password Access (https://support.itglue.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004938078-Getting-started-with-the-IT-Glue-API)
* Time it takes awhile when you have a lot of passwords in your IT Glue account
